### Favorite CPSC 120L labs

* Lab 7, part 2

    I found this lab  enjoyable due to the precision required in declaring variables and writing statements, all  from interpreting a parking sign's image. Examining each sign carefully, confirming the designated time, as either less or greater than the required timeframe.

* Lab 10, part 2

    This lab was quite different from what I anticipated. It was fascinating to witness the outcome or solution unfold while exploring if a county was incorrectly inputted. If it wasn't on the list, it let you know, and if it was, it provided the precise population number. Observing this was genuinely intriguing and quite cool.

 * Lab 11, part 2

    Creating this guessing game with the computer, trying to choose the number it had chosen, was entertaining. The  randomness inserted by the number generator code into this game added to its charm. Crafting the code required numerous statements enhancing the repetition.
